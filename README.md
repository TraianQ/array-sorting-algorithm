#Sorting Algorithms for Integer Arrays
We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays

## Bubble Sort

The bubble sort algorithm sorts the array in descending order

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

The Radix sort algorithm is considered one of the fastest sorting algorithms.

The algorithms is implemented in C.
